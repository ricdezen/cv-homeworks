# De Zen Riccardo - Homework 1

For the first homework I'm submitting my code and reports for lab experiences 2 and 3.
To compile and run the code cmake should be enough.

I have commented out a line in `CMakeLists.txt` because it might not be needed on all machines
depending on platform and environment variables. It was needed on my main pc.

Both programs accept command line arguments to specify data paths. I always used the default datasets
provided for the labs. A help (`-h` or `--help`) argument is available for both programs.

**Tools**:
- Windows 10 Home.
- OpenCV 4.5.2 compiled manually with MinGW.
- CLion 2021.1.1.
